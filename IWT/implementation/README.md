# Implementation for IWT || **Pickle Rick**

I have left comments where something might seem weird or unclear.
Formatting is the result if prettier, I know it looks weird sometimes.

The highlighting of where you currently are on the webpage is happening by adding the page title to the logo in the top right.

This webpage isn't fully responsive because it would require me to rewrite a lot of things, which sadly isn't possibly at this remaining time frame.
But most things resize according to screen width.

Images are compressed.

I hope this thing works, thank you and till we meet again.
